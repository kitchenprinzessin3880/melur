Absolute Humidity		Absolute humidity is the mass of water in a particular volume of air. It is a measure of the density of water vapor in an atmosphere.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#AbsoluteHumidity		0		13	3	3
Absorbed Dose		Absorbed dose (also known as Total Ionizing Dose, TID) is a measure of the energy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation. It is equal to the energy deposited per unit mass of medium, and so has the unit J/kg, which is given the special name Gray (Gy).|Note that the absorbed dose is not a good indicator of the likely biological effect. 1 Gy of alpha radiation would be much more biologically damaging than 1 Gy of photon radiation for example. Appropriate weighting factors can be applied reflecting the different relative biological effects to find the equivalent dose.|The risk of stoctic effects due to radiation exposure can be quantified using the effective dose, which is a weighted average of the equivalent dose to each organ depending upon its radiosensitivity. When ionising radiation is used to treat cancer, the doctor will usually prescribe the radiotherapy treatment in Gy. When risk from ionising radiation is being discussed, a related unit, the Sievert is used.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#AbsorbedDose	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Absorbed_dose	0		13	3	3

Acceleration		Acceleration is the (instantaneous) rate of change of velocity. Acceleration may be either linear acceleration, or angular acceleration. It is a vector quantity with dimension length/time^2 for linear acceleration, or in the case of angular acceleration, with dimension angle/time^2. In SI units, linear acceleration is measured in meters/second^2 (m·s^-2) and angular acceleration is measured in radians/second^2. |In common speech, the term acceleration is only used for an increase in speed.

Angle		The inclination to each other of two intersecting lines, measured by the arc of a circle intercepted between the two lines forming the angle, the center of the circle being the point of intersection. An acute angle is less than 90°; a right angle 90 °; an obtuse angle, more than 90° but less than 180 °; a straight angle, 180°; a reflex angle, more than 180° but less than 360°; a perigon, 360°. Any angle not a multiple of 90° is an oblique angle. If the sum of two angles is 90°, they are complementary angles; if 180°, supplementary angles; if 360°, explementary angles. Two adjacent angles have a common vertex and lie on opposite sides of a common side. A dihedral angle is the angle between two intersecting planes.

Angular Momentum		Quantity of rotational motion. |Linear momentum is the quantity obtained by multiplying the mass of a body by its linear velocity. Angular momentum is the quantity obtained by multiplying the moment of inertia of a body by its angular velocity. The momentum of a system of particles is given by the sum of the momenta of the individual particles which make up the system or by the product of the total mass of the system and the velocity of the center of gravity of the system. The momentum of a continuous medium is given by the integral of the velocity over the mass of the medium or by the product of the total mass of the medium and the velocity of the center of gravity of the medium.|In physics, the angular momentum of an object rotating about some reference point is the measure of the extent to which the object will continue to rotate about that point unless acted upon by an external torque. In particular, if a point mass rotates about an axis, then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the mass of the object, the velocity and the distance of the mass to the axis. While the motion associated with linear momentum has no absolute frame of reference, the rotation associated with angular momentum is sometimes spoken of as being measured relative to the fixed stars.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#AngularMomentum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angular_momentum	0		13	3	3

Area Thermal Expansion		When the temperature of a substance changes, the energy that is stored in the intermolecular bonds between atoms changes. When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.|Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:| * linear thermal expansion| * area thermal expansion| * volumetric thermal expansion|These characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.|Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients.

Atmospheric Pressure		The pressure exerted at a point due to the presence of an atmosphere. In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. Low pressure areas have less atmospheric mass above their location, whereas high pressure areas have more atmospheric mass above their location. Similarly, as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that pressure decreases with increasing elevation.

Compressibility Factor	Z	The compressibility factor (Z) is a useful thermodynamic property for modifying the ideal gas law to account for the real gas behaviour. The closer a gas is to a phase change, the larger the deviations from ideal behavior. Values for compressibility are calculated using equations of state (EOS), such as the virial equation and van der Waals equation.

Curvature		The canonical example of extrinsic curvature is that of a circle, which has curvature equal to the inverse of its radius everywhere. Smaller circles bend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. The curvature of a smooth curve is defined as the curvature of its osculating circle at each point. The osculating circle of a sufficiently smooth plane curve at a given point on the curve is the circle whose center lies on the inner normal line and whose curvature is the same as that of the given curve at that point. This circle is tangent to the curve at the given point. That is, given a point P on a smooth curve C, the curvature of C at P is defined to be 1/R where R is the radius of the osculating circle of C at P. The magnitude of curvature at points on physical curves can be measured in diopters (also spelled dioptre) — this is the convention in optics.

Data Rate		"The frequency derived from the period of time required to transmit one bit. This represents the amount of data transferred per second by a communications channel or a computing or storage device. Data rate is measured in units of bits per second (written ""b/s"" or ""bps""), bytes per second (Bps), or baud. When applied to data rate, the multiplier prefixes ""kilo-"", ""mega-"", ""giga-"", etc. (and their abbreviations, ""k"", ""M"", ""G"", etc.) always denote powers of 1000. For example, 64 kbps is 64,000 bits per second.

Electric Dipole Moment		The Electric Dipole Moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges in a system of (discrete or continuous) charges. It is a vector-valued quantity. If the system of charges is neutral, that is if the sum of all charges is zero, then the dipole moment of the system is independent of the choice of a reference frame; however in a non-neutral system, such as the dipole moment of a single proton, a dependence on the choice of reference point arises. In such cases it is conventional to choose the reference point to be the center of mass of the system or the center of charge, not some arbitrary origin. This convention ensures that the dipole moment is an intrinsic property of the system.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#ElectricDipoleMoment		0		13	3	3
Electric Displacement Field	D	In a dielectric material the presence of an electric field E causes the bound charges in the material (atomic nuclei and their electrons) to slightly separate, inducing a local electric dipole moment.

The electric potential Φ(x) at a point, x, is formally defined as the line integral of the electric field taken along a path from x to the point at infinity. If the electric field is static, i.e. time independent, then the choice of the path is arbitrary; however if the electric field is time dependent, taking the integral along different paths will produce different results.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#ElectricPotential		0		13	3	3
Electric Power		Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. In the simple case of direct current circuits, electric power can be calculated as the product of the potential difference in the circuit (V) and the amount of current flowing in the circuit (I):|P = VI|where |P is the power|V is the potential difference|I is the current.|However, in general electric power is calculated by taking the integral of the vector cross-product of the electrical and magnetic fields over a specified area.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#ElectricPower		0		13	3	3
Electric Quadrupole Moment	Q	The Electric Quadrupole Moment is a quantity which describes the effective shape of the ellipsoid of nuclear charge distribution. A non-zero quadrupole moment Q indicates that the charge distribution is not spherically symmetric.

In general, the electric quadrupole moment is tensor-valued.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#ElectricQuadrupoleMoment		0		13	3	3
Electromotive Force	ℰ	"In physics, electromotive force, or most commonly emf (seldom capitalized), or (occasionally) electromotance is ""that which tends to cause current (actual electrons and ions) to flow.""[1]. More formally, emf is the external work expended per unit of charge to produce an electric potential difference across two open-circuited terminals.[2][3] The electric potential difference is created by separating positive and negative charges, thereby generating an electric field.[4][5] The created electrical potential difference drives current flow if a circuit is attached to the source of emf. When current flows, however, the voltage across the terminals of the source of emf is no longer the open-circuit value, due to voltage drops inside the device due to its internal resistance.

Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist.|The SI unit for torque is newton meters (N m). In U.S. customary units, it is measured in foot pounds (ft lbf) (also known as 'pounds feet'). |Mathematically, the torque on a particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product:|τ = r x F|where|r is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum |F is the force acting on the particles, |or, more generally, torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum,|τ = dL/dt|where|L is the angular momentum vector |t stands for time.

Total Pressure	P_0	The total pressure is the sum of the dynamic and static pressures, i.e. P_0 = P + q.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#TotalPressure		0		13	3	3
Turbidity		Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid, or of air, caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#Turbidity	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turbidity	0		13	3	3

Viscosity		"Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear stress or extensional stress. In general terms it is the resistance of a liquid to flow, or its ""thickness"". Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction.

Volume		The volume of a solid object is the three-dimensional concept of how much space it occupies, often quantified numerically. One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#Volume	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volume	0		13	3	3

Volume Thermal Expansion		When the temperature of a substance changes, the energy that is stored in the intermolecular bonds between atoms changes. When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.|Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:| * linear thermal expansion| * area thermal expansion| * volumetric thermal expansion|These characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.|Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients.

Vorticity	ω	"In the simplest sense, vorticity is the tendency for elements of a fluid to ""spin."" More formally, vorticity can be related to the amount of ""circulation"" or ""rotation"" (or more strictly, the local angular rate of rotation) in a fluid. The average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the circulation C around the boundary of the small region, divided by the area A of the small region. Mathematically, vorticity is a vector field and is defined as the curl of the velocity field."		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#Vorticity		0		13	3	3
Weight		1. The force with which a body is attracted toward an astronomical body. |2. The product of the mass of a body and the acceleration acting on a body. |In a dynamic situation, the weight can be a multiple of that under resting conditions. Weight also varies on other planets in accordance with their gravity.		http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/quantity#Weight	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weight	0		13	3	3
